                                            My illusion, my mistake
                                            I was careless, I forgot, I did
                                            And now
                                            Hey
                                            Falling out of love is hard
                                            Falling for betrayal is worse
                                            Broken trust and broken hearts
                                            I know, I know
                                            And thinking all you need is there
                                            Building faith on love and words
                                            Empty promises will wear
                                            I know
                                            I know and now
                                            When all is done, there is nothing to say
                                            You have gone and so effortlessly
                                            You have won, you can go ahead, tell them
                                            Tell them all I know now
                                            Shout it from the rooftops
                                            Write it on the skyline
                                            All we had is gone now
                                            Tell them I was happy
                                            And my heart is broken
                                            All my scars are open
                                            Tell them all I hoped would be impossible
                                            Impossible

                                            Leaked through and covered me

                                            Come away with innocence and leave me with my sins
                                            The air around me still feels like a cage
                                            And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again
                                            So if you love me let me go
                                            And run away before I know
                                            My heart is just too dark to care
                                            I can't destroy what isn't there
                                            Deliver me into my fate
                                            If I'm alone I cannot hate
                                            I don't deserve to have you
                                            Ooh, my smile was taken long ago
                                            If I can change I hope I never know
                                            I still press your letters to my lips
                                            And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
                                            I couldn't face a life without your lights
                                            But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight
                                            So save your breath, I will not care
                                            I think I made it very clear
                                            You couldn't hate enough to love
                                            Is that supposed to be enough?
                                            I only wish you weren't my friend
                                            Then I could hurt you in the end
                                            I never claimed to be a saint
                                            Ooh, my own was banished long ago
                                            It took the death of hope to let you go
                                            So break yourself against my stones
                                            And spit your pity in my soul
                                            You never needed any help
                                            You sold me out to save yourself
                                            And I won't listen to your shame
                                            You ran away, you're all the same
                                            Angels lie to keep control
                                            Ooh, my love was punished long ago
                                            If you still care don't ever let me know
                                            If you still care don't ever let me know</h4>
